# AutoFartkey :poop:
The peak of technology. Pressing any key causes your PC to fart.

## WTF is it exactly?
AutoFartkey is a small immature [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) Script I wrote for fun. It listens for keypresses and plays random fart sounds.

## Features
- Changeable sound folder - Play your own sounds! (wav, ogg & mp3)
- Configurable probability of a fart/keypress
- Detect only mouse or keyboard or both
- Fart counter - So there's no denial that it was you...
- Hidden when active - reopen with F2

The included sound files are from [Jagadamba @ freesound.org](https://freesound.org/people/Jagadamba/packs/15564/).
